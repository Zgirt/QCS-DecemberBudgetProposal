Overview
-----------------------------------------------
Qubic Core Services (QCS) is requesting funding from the Computor Control Fund (CCF) to fund running costs like overhead (salaries and expenses) and to fund basic activities for Marketing, Ecosystem Development, Community Management, Strategy, Finance and Operations.

This is a follow-up request from the approved Qubic Core Services base budget proposal. (https://github.com/Zgirt/QCS-Revised-Budget/blob/d26d24e/README.md)


Now we request the budget for the month of December.
The community has been engaged early while discussing the proposal. For an overview of the detailed budget proposal and FAQ, please visit:

Price update, we now computed with a price of 3000 per billion:

Table 2

USD 3000/bn because its the 3 day moving average on daily. Higher is risky and lower not appropriate in our opinion. excess budget due to price move will be rolled forward.
